# Gender Detection with Deep Learning


## Overview

This repository contains a gender detection model implemented using deep learning techniques. The model is designed to predict the gender of individuals based on their images. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to automatically extract features from the input images and make accurate gender predictions.

## Key Features

- **CNN Model**: The gender detection model is built using a custom CNN architecture, which has been trained on a large dataset of male and female images to achieve high accuracy.

- **Custom Dataset**: The model has been trained on a custom dataset of male and female images, ensuring inclusivity and diversity to make accurate predictions for individuals with different appearances.

- **Data Augmentation**: To prevent overfitting and improve generalization, data augmentation techniques have been applied during training to create variations of the training data.

- **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate validation set to assess its effectiveness.

- **Model Deployment**: This repository also includes scripts for deploying the trained model, allowing users to make gender predictions on new images through a user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gender-detection.git
   cd gender-detection
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Train the model on your custom dataset:

   - Organize your dataset into separate folders for male and female images.
   - Update the `data_directory`, `img_height`, `img_width`, and `batch_size` variables in `train_model.py`.
   - Run the training script:

     ```bash
     python train_model.py
     ```

   The trained model will be saved as `gender_detector_model.h5`.

2. Make gender predictions on new images:

   - Put the images you want to predict in the `test_images` folder.
   - Update the `model_file` variable in `predict_gender.py` with the path to the trained model (`gender_detector_model.h5`).
   - Run the prediction script:

     ```bash
     python predict_gender.py
     ```

   The predictions will be displayed along with the corresponding images.

## Acknowledgments

We acknowledge the use of pre-trained models, open-source libraries, and publicly available datasets that have contributed to the development of this gender detection project.

## Disclaimer

This gender detector is not guaranteed to be 100% accurate, and its predictions should be used with caution. Gender identity is complex and personal, and appearances may not accurately represent an individual's gender identity. We encourage users to treat gender classification models with sensitivity and respect for diversity.
